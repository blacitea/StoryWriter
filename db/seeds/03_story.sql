The sun’s almost setting, and the only noises are the sounds of the bug Pokémon and the occasional Rattata waking up early and chattering its teeth. You pass through without adding much to the noise yourself.

It’s not a long walk to get past the cemetery and find the motel and house at the top of the hill. It’s maybe taken you half an hour to get from Hala’s house to here, and you’re slightly out of breath as you walk – no matter how much traveling you do, the hills always get you.

You start to walk onto the porch of the small house with lights gleaming from its windows when you hear a creaking sound that’s not coming from the boards under your feet. You back up and walk to the side of the house, where the fenced-in yard sits. And there he is.

It’s almost comical to see Guzma sitting on the child’s swing. He’s so tall his head nearly brushes the top pole, and he looks squeezed by the seat and the chains hanging too close together to really hold his frame. He idly pushes off with his foot every once in a while, moving back a few inches, making the chains groan and whine.

I haven’t told you about Brock?” he asked, and stopped walking, swinging his pack off his shoulder and kneeling down in a single movement. Although it had been dancing with Bonnie, Pikachu noticed them stopping and ran over, chirruping interest as Ash pulled out a wallet. It jumped up onto his head as he stood up again and held the wallet out. “Here… this is Brock. He’s training to become a Pokemon Doctor, but he used to be a Breeder and a Gym Leader.”', '2020-07-20 00:45:02.85335', '2020-07-20 00:46:02.85335');

He’s staring out into the distance, too lost in thought to notice you. Instead of his usual short-sleeved sweater, he wears a long-sleeved jacket that somehow seems too big for him, even at his size, with the sleeves wide in one of the more popular traditional Alolan styles. His hair is its usual mess, but he doesn’t seem to be wearing his usual eyeshadow, making the bags under his eyes less pronounced.

Finally, you just say, “Hey.” He looks up, furrows his brow, and growls. Trying to find something to say, you blurt, “What are you doing here?”

“Living.” He clings tighter to the swing chains. “What are you doing here?”', '2020-07-21 00:45:02.85335', '2020-07-21 00:46:02.85335');

Somehow you don’t think he’d appreciate being told that Hala wanted you to check in on him.

“Whatever.” He looks away, staring off into the distance again. The light from the nearest house window throws light over his right side, throwing it into sharp relief against the dark shadows the sunset causes.

He’s acting… odd. Much less cocky than usual. You ask, “Do you have any plans?”', '2020-07-23 00:45:02.85335');
