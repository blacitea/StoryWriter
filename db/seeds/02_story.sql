They were in the middle of nowhere, walking a little slower than normal since Bonnie was happily dancing, swinging Puny around over her head, rather than walk properly. But she was so thrilled that none of them had it in them to stop her.

“No, though the rhyhorn sure felt like family!” Serena said happily, and Ash chuckled. She grinned at him. “You don’t either, right?”

“Nah. But I had Brock for a while; he felt a lot like a big brother.”

“Brock?” they repeated, and he blinked at them before grinning.

I haven’t told you about Brock?” he asked, and stopped walking, swinging his pack off his shoulder and kneeling down in a single movement. Although it had been dancing with Bonnie, Pikachu noticed them stopping and ran over, chirruping interest as Ash pulled out a wallet. It jumped up onto his head as he stood up again and held the wallet out. “Here… this is Brock. He’s training to become a Pokemon Doctor, but he used to be a Breeder and a Gym Leader.”', '2020-07-20 00:45:02.85335', '2020-07-20 00:46:02.85335');

He was the best cook, and really smart. You’d really like him.”

Clemont tried to push down an irrational spike of jealousy, while Serena smiled awkwardly and pointed at the girl. “And this…?”', '2020-07-21 00:45:02.85335', '2020-07-21 00:46:02.85335');

“Can I see the other photos?” Clemont asked, and Ash shrugged, handing it over. Serena ducked around to walk beside Clemont, and together they flicked to the end. Clemont refused to admit he was checking out his latest competition, but still jerked when he found himself looking at what was definitely a very young Ash. Only then did he remember Ash was from Kanto and they read books back to front. Probably not the end, then.

“Wait, I know this kid,” Serena said, and Clemont blinked, then looked at the picture again. Young Ash had his arm around an equally young boy with spiky brown hair. “He was at the Pokemon Camp too.”', '2020-07-22 00:45:02.85335', '2020-07-22 00:46:02.85335');

Clemont hesitated. Since most of his pokemon career had been spent as a gym leader, he’d never had to give up a pokemon. Shinx was the closest, and it had never actually been his before they met again. But it was obvious Ash hadn’t taken his experiences easily. So rather than comment, Clemont just flipped to the next photo.', '2020-07-24 00:48:02.85335');
