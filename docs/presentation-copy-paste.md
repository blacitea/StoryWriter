"No way!" you shout. "I just thought there might be a cool Pokemon behind the rockslide, and wanted to see if it was worth looking at." You feel really cool for handling the situation like this.

# STORY
Everything was dark and musky around Serena as she walked down one of the alleys in Lumiose City. She clutched herself tighter, the coolness around her seeping into her skin. Although it was sometime around noon when she had first entered the city in the middle of the summer, it felt like it was autumn or even winter time. She wished that she had invested in a jacket before coming to the city.
