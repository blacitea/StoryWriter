// Stories

As a non logged-in user, I want to browse all stories, so I can pick one to read
As a non logged-in user, I want to read stories, because I want to see what people are writing
As a non logged-in user, I cannot write, add to, or vote on stories, because those things need to be tracked

As a user, I want to start my own stories, because I want to collaborate with others
As a user, I want to add contributions to stories, because I want to help tell a story
As a user, I want to vote on contributions, and see votes, because I want to know if people like my contribution

As the story owner, I want to pick the next contribution to add to the story, because I want to control my story
As the story owner, I want to be able to mark a story as finished, to let others know not to add any more
As the story owner, I want to be able to delete a story, because I might want to cancel the collaboration

As a user, I cannot edit a post after it is sent, because stories need to be consistent
